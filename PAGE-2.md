### **Why is $`\sqrt{2}`$ irrational?**

We have learnt that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. Have you seen the proof?<br>
Here we go.

```math
\begin{alignat*}{5}
&\small\text{let }\normalsize\qquad\qquad&\sqrt{2}\quad&=\quad&&\frac{a}{b}\\
&\rlap{\small\text{where a and b are unsigned integers and }\frac{a}{b}\text{ is the simplest fraction.}}\\
&\rlap{\small\text{either of them can be even, but not both.}}\\
&\rlap{\small\text{otherwise, if both are even, we can simplify further.}}\\
&\,&2\quad&=&&\frac{a^2}{b^2}\qquad&\small\text{(1)}\\
&\,&a^2\quad&=&&2b^2\\
&\rlap{\small\text{so }a^2\text{ is even, and }a\text{ is also even, because }odd^2\text{ is odd.}}\\
&\small\text{let }&a\quad&=&&2k\\
&\small\text{(1)}&2\quad&=&&\frac{(2k)^2}{b^2}\\
&\,&2\quad&=&&\frac{4k^2}{b^2}\\
&\,&b^2\quad&=&&\frac{4k^2}{2}\\
&\,&b^2\quad&=&&2k^2\\
&\rlap{\small\text{so }b^2\text{ is even, and }b\text{ is also even.}}\\
&\rlap{\small\text{so }a\text{ and }b\text{ are both even, and they can be simplified further.}}\\
&\rlap{\small\text{so the assumption }\sqrt{2}=\frac{a}{b}\text{ is wrong,}}\\
&\rlap{\small\text{Thus }\sqrt{2}\text{ is irrational.}\qquad\qquad\text{(valid proof)}}\\
\end{alignat*}
```
